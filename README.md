# Sauerbraten SDL2 Client binaries

Sauerbraten SDL2 Client client for windows/linux. It also has some
additional features, that have been missing for years (all of them are
disabled by default and separate configuration files are used). Use
"extendedsettings" command for configuring. SLD2 port is based on SDOS
client code.
